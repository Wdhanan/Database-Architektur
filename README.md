# Database-Architektur
I made a small Java Application where it is possible to see
all the 3 Part of a Database App which are :View,Modell and the 
Control-Part.Each of them are fully making their roles
without disturbing the other Part
.I'm still working on it but this Time 
with JPA and JPQL.This reduces considerably
the lines of Code and are used in a real or big
Database-Application context
